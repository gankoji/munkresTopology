* Connected Spaces 
Definition: A \textit{separation} of $X$ is a pair $U,V$ of disjoint nonempty
open susbets of $X$ whose union is $X$. The space $X$ is said to be
\textit{connected} if there does not exist a separationof $X$. 

Note that connectedness is formulated entirely in terms of the collection of
open sets of $X$. Thus, connectedness is a topological property, and any space
that is homeomorphic to a connected space is itself connected.
