* Closed Sets and Limit Points <2020-02-05 Wed 09:04>

Recall that a set $A$ is closed iff its complement $X\setminus A$ is
open.

$int(A)$ [The interior of A] is the union of all open sets contained in $A$. 

$cl(A)$ [The closure of A] is the intersection of all closed sets
containing $A$.

#+begin_theorem
Let $Y$ be a subspace of $X$, $A \subseteq Y$. The closure of $A$ in
$Y$ equals $cl(A) \cap Y$.
#+end_theorem

#+begin_definition
Two sets $A,B$ \textbf{intersect} if their intersection is not empty,
i.e. $A \cap B \not= \emptyset$.
#+end_definition

#+begin_theorem
Let $A \subseteq X$. Then, $x \in cl(A)$ iff every open set containing
$x$ intersects $A$. Also, if the topology of $X$ is given by a basis,
$x \in cl(A)$ iff every basis element of $B$ containing $x$ intersects $A$.

#+end_theorem

WEIRD MOMENT: Munkres doesn't mention this, but we worked it through
in class. Need to add the requirement/assumption that $x\in X$ in
order for this theorem to work.

** Example

$X = \mathbb{R}_{std}, A = (0,1]$. Then, $cl(A) = [0,1]$.

$B = \{ 1/n\ |\ n \in \mathbb{N}\}$. Then, $cl(B) = \{0\}\cup B$.

$cl(\mathbb{Q}) = \mathbb{R}$.

$\overline{\mathbb{R}\setminus\mathbb{Q}} = \mathbb{R}$.

Let $Y = (0,1] \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, $A = (0, 1/2) \subseteq
Y$. Closure of $A$ in $\mathbb{R}$ is $[0,1/2]$. Closure in $Y$ is
$Y\cap \overline{A} = (0,1/2]$.

*** Sidenote
I noticed this morning, as I was furiously trying to update my config
to get it up to speed for notetaking (since I goofed and didn't sync
my changes from the desktop last night), that the laptop has code
completion in elisp (and I'm suspecting, probably elsewhere). Diff the
configs and see what's different, since I'm missing that on both the
work and home pcs. 

** Limit points
#+begin_definition
If $X$ is a topological space, $A\subseteq X$, $x \in X$, then $x$ is
a limit point of $A$ if every open neighborhood of $x$ intersects $A$
in some point other than $x$ itself. 
#+end_definition

Limit points of $A$ may not be in $A$, but they also could be. It
tells us about the structure of $A$ if it contains all of its limit
points.

Note: $U$ is an open neighborhood of $x$ iff $U$ is open and $x \in
U$.

*** Examples of limit points
$A = (0,1]$. Here, 0 is a limit point of $A$. So is every point in
$A$.

$B= \{ 1/n\ |\ n\in\mathbb{N}\}$. 0 is a limit point of $B$. Points of
$B$ are not limit points. Note that the "open neighborhoods" of a
point should come from some underlying space, not just the set under
consideration. 0 is the only limit point. 

Note: $x$ is a limit point of $A$ iff $x \in
\overline{A\setminus\{x\}}$.

** The ambitious theorem <2020-02-05 Wed 09:41>
#+begin_theorem
Let $A \subseteq X$, $X$ a topological space. Let $A'$ be the set of
limit points of $A$. Then, $\overline{A} = A\cup A'$.
#+end_theorem

#+begin_proof
Inclusion in both directions. 

As observed earlier, $A \subseteq \overline{A}$. Also, by definition,
every limit point of $A$ is in $\overline{A}$, since a limit point has
its open neighborhoods intersect $A$, and the closure points also have
open neighborhoods intersect $A$. Thus, $A\cup A' \subseteq \overline{A}$ is
obvious.

Suppose $x \in \overline{A}$. If $x \in A$, then done. Suppose $x \ni
A$. $x \in \overline{A}$, so every open neighborhood $U$ of $x$
intersects $A$. Let $y \in U\cap A$. $y\not = x$, since $y \in A$. So,
$x$ is a limit point, and thus $x \in A'$. We've proven both cases, so
$\overline{A} \subseteq A\cup A'$.
#+end_proof

If a point is in the closure of a set, it is either \textit{in the set
itself}, or it its \textit{a limit point} of it. There are no other
possibilities.

* Closed Sets Again, and maybe Hausdorff Spaces? <2020-02-07 Fri 09:00>
#+begin_definition
If $X$ is a topological space, $A\subseteq X$, $x \in X$ then $x$ is a
limit point of $A$ if every neighborhood of $x$ intersects $A$ in a
point other than $x$ itself.

I.e. $\forall U$ open with $x \in U$, $(U\setminus\{x\})\cap A
\not=\emptyset$.
#+end_definition

#+begin_theorem
Let $A\subseteq X$, $A'$ a set of limit points of $A$. Then
$\overline{A} = A\cup A'$.
#+end_theorem

#+begin_corollary
A subset $A$ of a topological space is closed iff $\overline{A} =
A$. (This holds iff $\overline{A} \subseteq A$ iff $ A' \subseteq A$.
#+end_corollary

** Hausdorff Spaces
Hausdorff property is important for convergence of sequences.

Consider a one point set in $\mathbb{R}$, say
$\{x_0\}$. $\overline{\{x_0\}} = \{x_0\}$.

So one point sets are closed in $\mathbb{R}$, but this is not true in
general.
