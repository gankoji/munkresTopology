* Problem 1

If $L$ is a straight line in the plane, describe the topology $L$
inherits as a subspace of $\mathbb{R}_l\times\mathbb{R}$ and as a subspace of
$\mathbb{R}_l\times\mathbb{R}_l$. In each case, it is a familiar topology.

To be precise, we define a line $L$ as a set of points $L = \{ x,y \in
\mathbb{R}^2 |\ y = mx + b, m,b \in \mathbb{R}\}$. In both cases, the
basis elements for the subspace topology $L$ inherits can be defined
as $\{ B_l\times B \cap L \}$.

As a subspace of $\mathbb{R}_l\times\mathbb{R}$, we have basis
elements of the form $[x_1,x_2)\times(y_1,y_2)\cap L$. Since a line is
one dimensional, we can parameterize $x,y$ as functions of a dummy
$t$, such that $y(t) = mx(t) + b$, and we are left with a one
dimensional set with the lower limit topology, i.e. $\mathbb{R}_l$.

The same holds for $L$ as a subspace of
$\mathbb{R}_l\times\mathbb{R}_l$.

* Problem 2

Let $I = [0,1]$. Compare the product topology on $I\times I$, the
dictionary order topology on $I\times I$, and the topology $I\times I$
inherits as a subspace of $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}$ in the dictionary order
topology.

The product topology on $I\times I$ is finer than the the dictionary
order topology on $I\times I$, which is both finer and coarser than
the subspace topology inherited from $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}$ in
the dictionary order topology.

#+BEGIN_proof

\textit{Product Topology is finer than the Dictionary Order Topology:}
The basis for the product topology is sets of the form
$((a,b),(c,d))$, $a,b,c,d \in I$. Basis elements of the dictionary
order topology are also intervals, with endpoints $(p_1,p_2)$ and
$(q_1,q_2)$: $B = \{ (a,b), a,b \in I\ |\ (p_1 < a \leq q_1)\
\text{or}\ (p_1 = a)\ \text{and}\ (p_2 < b \leq q_2)\}$.

Clearly, since both elements are drawn from the same set $I$, we can
find a slice $B$ in the dictionary order topology which contains any
given element $((a,b),(c,d))$ of the product topology, since elements
from the product topology do not contain their endpoints. The product
topology is finer than the dictionary order topology.

* Problem 3

Let $Y$ be a subspace of $X$. Prove that if $A$ is closed in $Y$ and
$Y$ is closed in $X$, then $A$ is closed in $X$.

#+BEGIN_proof

Let $A$ be closed in $Y$. Then its complement, $A_C = Y \setminus A$,
is open in $Y$ (and thus an element of the topology on $Y$). Since $Y$
is a subspace of $X$, $A_C$ is also an element in the topology of
$X$. Topologies are closed under arbitrary unions, so the set $A_{CX}
= A_C \cup (Y\setminus X)$ is also in the topology. Thus, the
complement of $A$ in $X$ is open, and therefore $A$ is closed in $X$.

#+END_proof

* Problem 4

Show that if $A$ is closed in $X$ and $B$ is closed in $Y$, then
$A\times B$ is closed in $X\times Y$.

#+BEGIN_proof

Let $A$ be closed in $X$, and $B$ be closed in $Y$. Then, $A_C =
A\setminus X$ is an element of the topology on $X$, and $B_C =
B\setminus Y$ is an element of the topology on $Y$. Since the product
topology on $X\times Y$ is inherited from the sets $X$ and $Y$, the
set $A_C \times B_C$ is in this product topology. This set is also the
complement of $A \times B$ in $X\times Y$. Thus, $A\times B$ is closed
in $X\times Y$.

#+END_proof

* Problem 5

Show that the dictionary order topology on the set
$\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}$ is the same as the product topology
$\mathbb{R}_d\times\mathbb{R}$ where $\mathbb{R}_d$ denotes
$\mathbb{R}$ in the discrete topology. Compare this topology with the
standard topology on $\mathbb{R}^2$.

#+BEGIN_proof

First, recall that a basis element in the dictionary order topology on
$\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}$ is an interval of the form $(p,q), p,q \in
\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}$.

Next, we note from theorem 15.1 we have that the basis for the product topology
on $\mathbb{R}_d\times\mathbb{R}$ is the collection of sets $D = \{ b\times
c\ |\ b\in B, c\in C\}$, where $B,C$ are the bases of the discrete and standard
topologies on $\mathbb{R}$, respectively.

To the proof. Let $A = ({x},(a,b))$ be a basis element of
$\mathbb{R}_d\times\mathbb{R}$. Choose $p_1, p_2 \in \mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R},
p_1 = (a_1,b_1), p_2 = (a_2,b_2)$. Then, let $a_1 = a_2 = x$. Clearly, then, the
interval $(p_1,p_2) = ({a_1},(b_1,b_2))$, which is equivalent to our chosen $A$
from the product topology. Thus, for any element of the topology on
$\mathbb{R}_d\times\mathbb{R}$, we can find an equivalent element in
$\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}_{DOT}$.
$\mathbb{R}_d\times\mathbb{R}\subseteq\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}_{DOT}$.

Next, let $p = (a,b)$ and $q = (c,d)$. Then, we can choose elements of the basis
of $\mathbb{R}_d\times\mathbb{R}$ as $r_i = ({p + i\epsilon}, (b,d))$. By
construction, $r_i \in C$, the basis on $\mathbb{R}_d\times\mathbb{R}$. Let $R =
\bigcup\limits_{i \in J}r_i = (p,q)$. Topologies are closed under arbitrary
unions, so $R \in C$ as well. But $R = (p,q)$, so $(p,q) \in
\mathbb{R}_d\times\mathbb{R}$, and
$\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}_{DOT}\subseteq\mathbb{R}_d\times\mathbb{R}$.
Therefore, $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}_{DOT} = \mathbb{R}_d\times\mathbb{R}$.

#+END_proof

Next, we prove that $\mathbb{R}_d\times\mathbb{R}$ is strictly finer than
$\mathbb{R}^2_{std}$.

#+BEGIN_proof

Let $A = ({x},(a,b))$ be a basis element of $\mathbb{R}_d\times\mathbb{R}$.
Choose $c < x < d, c,d \in\mathbb{R}$, and let $S = ((c,d),(a,b))$. Clearly, $S
\in \mathbb{R}^2_{std}$, by construction, and also $A \subset S$.
$\mathbb{R}_d\times\mathbb{R}$ is finer than $\mathbb{R}^2_{std}$.

However, we cannot go the other way. Topologies are only closed under finite
intersections, and we cannot make the set $A$ by any finite number of
intersections of sets of the form of $S$, due to the completeness of the reals
(equivalently, the nested interval principle).

Thus, $\mathbb{R}_d\times\mathbb{R}$ is strictly finer than
$\mathbb{R}^2_{std}$.
